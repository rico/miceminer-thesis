\section{Accessing and exploring the Data }
\label{sec:dataaccessandexp}

%In the field of computer technology the process of scanning a huge pool of data  interesting datais called \textit{data mining}.

Data exploration to scan data for interesting aspects.

\subsection{Introducing miceminer}
\label{subsec:dataexp}

\begin{itemize} 
	\item technology
	\item installation	
	\item usability
	\item limitations	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Filtering}
\label{subsubsec:datafilter}

Shortly explain the filtering possibilities of the program.

\subsubsection{Data Visualization}
\label{subsubsec:datavis}

Shortly explain the visualization possibilities of the program.

\subsubsection{Exporting Data}
\label{subsubsec:dataexp}

Shortly explain the export function of the program.

\subsection{Data analysis with miceminer}
\label{subsec:dataana} 

Miceminer provides some simple data analysis functionality.

\subsubsection{Home Range Data}
\label{subsubsec:homerangedata} 

Functionality of the home range analysis.

Minimal polygon calculation for boxes area.
Applying threshold which boxes to take into account calculation. 

Exporting dbf files which can be imported into ARCGIS.

\paragraph{Applications}
Above method is outdated, nowadays Kernel Density Estimation is used -> Anna

\subsubsection{Shared Preferences}
\label{subsubsec:sharedpref} 

Is there a preference between to female mice.
Calculate if two females meet more often than expected, which lets us draw conclusions about a their relationship.

\paragraph{Applications}
Prof. Koenig ?

\subsubsection{Monthly Box}
\label{subsubsec:monthbox}

A matrix  showing which mice has been seen in which boxes over the selected time range.

\paragraph{Applications}
Prof. Koenig ?

\subsubsection{Monthly Antennas}
\label{subsubsec:monthant}

A matrix  showing which mice has been seen at which antennas over the selected time range.

\paragraph{Applications}
