\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In May 2008, the research group around Prof. Barbara K\"onig at the Institute of Zoology of the University of Z\"urich decided to take their research in the field of animal behavior to the next level. Especially interested in the complex social behavior of house mice \textit{(Mus domesticus)} they came up with the idea to design an automated system to collect spatial position data of mice living in a barn.

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{subsec:motivation}
The motivation for such an effort is to obtain a statistically relevant set of data to develop, test and prove scientific hypothesis about the complex social behavior of house mice. An automated system has the advantage that it collects data 24 hours a day, and the mice are in no way disturbed in their natural behavior by the presence of an observer.

My personal motivation derives from the interest in informatics and my study in biology. The project gave me a lot of room to enhance my skills in informatics, while working on an interesting biological topic. Additionally, I am interested in the \textit{Social Network Analysis} to study complex social behavior.

The system collecting the data in the barn has been developed and constructed by a company called \textit{NewBehavior}, a company based in Z\"urich. Thus, the main objective of this work was to develop software to store data and make it accessible to researchers for analysis 

\subsection{Tasks}
\label{subsec:task}
Handling the spatial position data collected by the automated system is challenging, as it includes several tasks which can be carried out only using informatics on a level that biologists normally can not cope with.

\subsubsection{Storing and Accessing the Data}
\label{subsubsec:storeaccess}
The data collected by the automated system must be stored securely. Therefore, part of the approach is to set up a \ac{RDBMS} (RDBMS). 

Also, an intuitive user interface must be available, to access the data, facilitate data exploration, and export to other software applications. Furthermore, the technology used to create the interface should be cross-platform compatible, to ensure maximal accessibility.

\subsubsection{Additional Tasks}
\label{subsubsec:additional}
Additionally, the user should be provided with an interface to carry out some simple statistical analysis.

Last but not least, some functionality should enable to graphically display the social network, and export data for a social network analysis.
