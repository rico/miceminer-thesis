\section{Final remarks}
\label{sec:final_remarks}

Unfortunately the development of the software took much more time then expected. Therefore I couldn't carry out the planned analysis of the social network. However, I think that the time invested in the development is spent well - the quality and reliability is high and the function volume appropriate for the needs of the reseachers involved in the project. Therefore I hope that the software can and will be used for the ongoing research projects.
