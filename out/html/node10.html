Introduction
</H2>

<P>
House mice (<I>Mus domesticus</I>) live under a multitude of different environmental conditions. Therefore they have to be very flexible in terms of their social, territorial an reproductive behavior [,,]. Under natural conditions house mice have a very low expectancy of life (&nbsp;100 to 150 days). During this short life span, female mice are eager to have as many offspring as possible. Living under optimal food conditions, a female mouse has a litter of 5-7 pups every four weeks [,]. The juvenile mortality is estimated to be between 50% and 85% [,,]. Having heavier pups is an advantage, as they can be weaned much faster, hence it has a positive influence on the future reproduction []. Litter size of wild house mice increases from the first to the second lactation, and decreases after the fifth lactation [,].
