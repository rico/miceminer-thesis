General social behavior
</H2>
House mice typically live in social groups which form a reproduction group. The groups usually include a dominant male, one or several females with their litters and possibly some subordinate males [,,,].

<P>
The mating habit is generally polyandric (a female has many male reproduction partners), but observations of monogamic living pairs have been reported []. Juvenile females are allowed to stay in the territory of their parents to raise their own offspring []. There is evidence of stranger females immigrating into social groups as well [,,,,].
