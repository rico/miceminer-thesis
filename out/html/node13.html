Communal nursing
</H3>

<P>
Over forty years ago, first observation of wild female house mice, belonging to the same reproduction group, which raise their pups in communal nests have been reported []. Ever since, this behavior has been noticed for house mice living under all kind of environmental conditions.[,,,,].

<P>
This is an astonishing behavior, as the energetic cost of lactation is extremely high, hence influences the females future reproduction. To wean a litter of about seven to eight pups, the mother has to produce 100 grams of milk within 22 days, which is equivalent to 1100 KJ []. Depending on the size of the litter and the duration of the lactation phase, the length of the interbirth intervals change [,,,].

<P>
Several experiments have been carried out with house mice living under laboratory conditions. Changes in group size and the composition of the group in terms of relatedness of the individuals revealed, that non-offspring nursing is an integral part of the reproductive behavior of female house mice in egalitarian groups. However, the probability for such mutualistic cooperation was highest when a female shared a nest with a familiar sister to form a low-skew society [].

<P>
According to Koenig [], the direct benefits of allomaternal care for the pups could be diverse. As there are, improved survival, improved future reproduction, improved growth or immunological benefits.

<P>
There are physiological benefits for the mother as well, which lead to an increase of their reproductive output. Of notably interest is the hypothesis named <I>Metabolic peak load reduction</I>. Explained in short, a solitary nursing female tends to have a peak of energy consumption during the nursing phase of her litter. Nevertheless, female house mice are limited in their maximal sustainable metabolism []. This limit depends on the age and physique of the individual and is called <I>metabolic ceiling</I>. Partial synchronization in reproduction within females of a group, combined with the communal nursing, can balance the energy demand for the individual female, as the burden of nursing the litter is divided. Hence, the energy demand for each female is always on a medium level []. 

<P>
However, cause to the artificial setup of the experiments, no conclusion about the communal nursing under natural conditions could be made.
